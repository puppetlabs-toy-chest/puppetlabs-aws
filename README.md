##Overview

The aws module manages Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources to build out cloud infrastructure.

##Description

Amazon Web Services exposes a powerful API for creating and managing
its Infrastructure as a Service platform. The aws module
allows you to drive that API using Puppet code. In the simplest case,
this allows you to create new EC2 instances from Puppet code. More
importantly, it allows you to describe your entire AWS infrastructure and
to model the relationships between different components.

##Setup

###Requirements

* Puppet 3.4 or greater
* Ruby 1.9 or greater
* Amazon AWS Ruby SDK (available as a gem)
* Retries gem

###Installing the aws module

1. Install the retries gem and the Amazon AWS Ruby SDK gem.

    * If you're using open source Puppet, the SDK gem should be installed into the same Ruby used by Puppet. Install the gems with these commands:

      `gem install aws-sdk-core`

      `gem install retries`

  * If you're running Puppet Enterprise, install both the gems with this command:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/gem install aws-sdk-core retries`

  * If you're running Puppet Enterprise 2015.2.0 or newer, install both the gems with this command:

      `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install aws-sdk-core retries`

  This allows the gems to be used by the Puppet Enterprise Ruby.

  * If you're running [Puppet Server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server), you need to make both gems available to JRuby with:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/puppetserver gem install aws-sdk-core retries`

  Once the gems are installed, restart Puppet Server.

2. Set these environment variables for your AWS access credentials:

  ~~~
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
  ~~~

  Alternatively, you can place the credentials in a file at
`~/.aws/credentials` based on the following template:

  ~~~
 [default]
  aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
  aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
  ~~~

  If you have Puppet running on AWS, and you're running the module examples, you can instead use [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/). To do this, assign the correct role to the instance from which you're running the examples. For a sample profile with all the required permissions, see the [IAM profile example](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/iam-profile/).

3. Finally, install the module with:

~~~
puppet module install puppetlabs-aws
~~~

#### A note on regions

By default the module looks through all regions in AWS when
determining if something is available. This can be a little slow. If you
know what you're doing you can speed things up by targeting a single
region using an environment variable.

~~~
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
~~~

#### A note on proxies

By default the module accesses the AWS API directly, but if you're in an
environment which doesn't have direct access you can provide a proxy
setting for all traffic like so:

~~~
export PUPPET_AWS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
~~~

#### Configuring the aws module using an ini file

The AWS region and HTTP proxy can be provided in a file called
`puppetlabs_aws_configuration.ini` in the Puppet confdir
(`$settings::confdir`) using this format:

    [default]
      region = us-east-1
      http_proxy = http://proxy.example.com:80

##Getting Started with aws

The aws module allows you to manage AWS using the Puppet DSL. To stand up an instance with AWS, use the `ec2_instance` type. The following code sets up a very basic instance:

~~~
ec2_instance { 'instance-name':
  ensure        => present,
  region        => 'us-west-1',
  image_id      => 'ami-123456', # you need to select your own AMI
  instance_type => 't1.micro',
}
~~~

##Usage

###Creating resources

You can also set up more complex EC2 instances with a variety of AWS features, as well as
load balancers and security groups.

**Set up an instance:**

~~~
ec2_instance { 'name-of-instance':
  ensure            => present,
  region            => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zone => 'us-east-1a',
  image_id          => 'ami-123456',
  instance_type     => 't1.micro',
  monitoring        => true,
  key_name          => 'name-of-existing-key',
  security_groups   => ['name-of-security-group'],
  user_data         => template('module/file-path.sh.erb'),
  tags              => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

**Set up a security group:**

~~~
ec2_securitygroup { 'name-of-group':
  ensure      => present,
  region      => 'us-east-1',
  description => 'a description of the group',
  ingress     => [{
    protocol  => 'tcp',
    port      => 80,
    cidr      => '0.0.0.0/0',
  },{
    security_group => 'other-security-group',
  }],
  tags        => {
    tag_name  => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

**Set up a load balancer:**

~~~
elb_loadbalancer { 'name-of-load-balancer':
  ensure                  => present,
  region                  => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zones      => ['us-east-1a', 'us-east-1b'],
  instances               => ['name-of-instance', 'another-instance'],
  security_groups         => ['name-of-security-group'],
  listeners               => [{
    protocol              => 'HTTP',
    load_balancer_port    => 80,
    instance_protocol     => 'HTTP',
    instance_port         => 80,
  },{
    protocol              => 'HTTPS',
    load_balancer_port    => 443,
    instance_protocol     => 'HTTPS',
    instance_port         => 8080,
    ssl_certificate_id    => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789000:server-certificate/yourcert.com',
  }],
  health_check            => {
    'healthy_threshold'   => '10',
    'interval'            => '30',
    'target'              => 'HTTP:80/health_check',
    'timeout'             => '5',
    'unhealthy_threshold' => '2'
  },
  tags                    => {
    tag_name              => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

To destroy any of these resources, set `ensure => absent`.

### Creating a stack

Let's create a simple stack, with a load balancer, instances, and security groups.

~~~
                          WWW
                           +
                           |
          +----------------|-----------------+
          |     +----------v-----------+     |
    lb-sg |     |         lb-1         |     |
          |     +----+------------+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+  +----v----+     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
   web-sg |     |  web-1  |  |  web-2  |     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
          |     +----+----+  +----+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+       |          |
          |     |         |       |          |
    db-sg |     |  db-1   <-------+          |
          |     |         |                  |
          |     +---------+                  |
          +----------------------------------+
~~~

We've supplied code for the creation of this stack in this module's tests directory. To run this code with Puppet apply, run:

~~~
puppet apply tests/create.pp --test
~~~

If you want to try this out from this directory without installing the
module, run the following:

~~~
puppet apply tests/create.pp --modulepath ../ --test
~~~

To destroy the resources created by the above, run the following:

~~~
puppet apply tests/destroy.pp --test
~~~

### Managing resources from the command line

The module has basic `puppet resource` support, so you can manage AWS resources from the command line.

For example, the following command lists all the security groups:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup
~~~

You can also create new resources:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=present description="test description" region=us-east-1
~~~

and then destroy them, all from the command line:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=absent region=sa-east-1
~~~


### Managing AWS infrastructure

You can use the aws module to audit AWS resources, launch autoscaling groups in VPC, perform unit testing, and more. The [examples](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples) directory in the module contains a variety of usage examples that should give you an idea of what's possible:

* [Puppet Enterprise](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/puppet-enterprise/): Start up a small Puppet Enterprise cluster using the AWS module.

  ensure                   => present,
  desired_count            => 1,
  task_definition          => 'dockerdocker',
  cluster                  => 'medium',

      'container_port'     => '8080',
      'load_balancer_name' => 'name-of-loadbalancer-elb'
    }
}
```

##### `cluster`
*Required* The name of the cluster to assign the service to

##### `deployment_configuration`

A hash with the keys of "maximum_percent" and "minimum_healthy_percent"
with integer values represnting percent.'

##### `desired_count`

##### `load_balancers`
An array of hashes representing the load balancers to assign to a service.

##### `name`
*Required* The name of the cluster to manage.

##### `role`
The short name of the role to assign to the cluster upon creation.

##### `task_definition`
*Required* The name of the task definition to run.

#### Type: ecs_task_definition

Type representing ECS clusters.

ECS task definitions can be a bit fussy.  To discover the existing containers
we use the 'name' option within a container definition to calculate the
differences between what is, and what should be.  Omitting the 'name' option may
be done, but it would result in a new container being generated each Puppet
run, and thus a new task definition.  For this reason it is recommended that
the 'name' option be defined in each container definition and that the name
chosen be unique within an `ecs_task_definition` resource.

```Puppet
ecs_task_definition { 'dockerdocker':
  container_definitions => [
    {
      'name'          => 'zleslietesting',
      'cpu'           => '1024',
      'environment'   => {
        'one' => '1',
        'two' => '2',
      },
      'essential'     => 'true',
      'image'         => 'debian:jessie',
      'memory'        => '512',
      'port_mappings' => [
        {
          'container_port' => '8081',
          'host_port'      => '8082',
          'protocol'       => 'tcp',
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
}
```

Please note, it's important to take into consideration the behavior of the
provider in the case of missing container options.

If the task for an `ecs_task_definition` has been discovered to exist, then the
discovered container options are merged with the requested options.  This
results in the following behavior: *Container options not defined in the puppet
resource, but are found to exist in the discovered running container are copied
from the running container.*

In the case where a user wishes to remove an option from the container, one of the following can be applied.

* Name the container something else.  This results in a failure to match the
  existing container against the desired container, and replaces the container
  entirely.

* Set an empty value for the option.  This results in the option specified by
  the user replacing the value defined in the existing container.  For string
  options, simply setting the value to `''`, or as an array value `[]`, etc.

It's a small kludge, I know.



##### `container_definitions`
An array of hashes representing the container definition.  See the example
above.

##### `name`
*Required* The name of the task to manage.

##### `volumes`
An array of hashes to handle for the task.

##### `replace_image`
A boolean to turn off the replacement of container images.  This enables Puppet
to create, but not modify the image of a container once created.

This is useful in environments where external CI tooling is responsible for
modifying the image of a container, allowing a dualistic approach for managing
ECS.

#### Type: iam_group

```Puppet
iam_group { 'root':
  ensure  => present,
  members => [ 'alice', 'bob' ]
}
```

#####`members`
*Required* An array of user names to include in the group.  Users not specified in this array will be removed.

#### Type: iam_policy

[IAM
Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
manage access to AWS resources.  The `iam_policy` type only manages the
document content of the policy, and not which entities have the policy
attached.  See the `iam_policy_attachment` type for managing the application of
the policy created with the `iam_policy` type.

```Puppet
iam_policy { 'root':
  ensure      => present,
  document    => '{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "*",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }',
}
```

It is worth noting here that the `iam_policy` type will allow the creation of
an IAM policy who's name is identical to the built-in policies.  In such a case
when two policies exist with the same name, one built-in and one user-defined,
the user-defined is selected for management.

#####`document`
*Required* A string containing the IAM policy in JSON format.

#### Type: iam_policy_attachment
The `iam_policy_attachment` resource manages which entities are attached to the
named policy.  See the note in the `iam_policy` above about duplicate policy
name selection.

You only need to set the `users`, `groups` or `roles` parameters to manage the
policy attachments for those resources.  Leaving one of those parameters
undefined ignores the attachment for those entities.  Defining attachment for
an entity as an empty array will detach all entities of that flavor from the
named policy.

```Puppet
iam_policy_attachment { 'root':
  groups => ['root'],
  users  => [],
}
```

#####`groups`
*Optional* An array of group names to attach to the policy.  **Group names not mentioned in this array will be detached from the policy.**

#####`users`
*Optional* An array of user names to attach to the policy.  **User names not mentioned in this array will be detached from the policy.**

#####`roles`
*Optional* An array of role names to attach to the policy.  **Role names not mentioned in this array will be detached from the policy.**

#### Type: iam_role
The `iam_role` type manages IAM roles.  

```
iam_role { 'devtesting':
  ensure => present,
  policy_document => '[
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]',
}
```

All parameters are read-only once created.

#####`ensure`
Specifies the basic state of the resource. Valid values are 'present', 'absent'

#####`name`
The name of the IAM role

#####`path`
Role path (optional)

#####`policy_document`
A string containing the IAM policy in JSON format which controls which entities may assume this role, e.g. the default:
 
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

#####`arn`
The Amazon Resource Name for this IAM role.

#### Type: iam_user
The `iam_user` type manages user accounts in IAM.  Only the user's name is
required as the title of the resource.

```

  ensure => present,
}

iam_user { 'bob':
  ensure => present,
}
```

##Limitations

This module requires Ruby 1.9 or later and is only tested on Puppet
versions 3.4 and later.

At the moment this module only supports a few of the resources
in the AWS API. These resources also exist a bit outside the
normal host level resources like `package`, `file`, `user`, etc. We're
really interested to see how people use these new resources, and what
else you would like to be able to do with the module.

Note that this module also requires at least Ruby 1.9 and is only tested on Puppet
versions from 3.4. If this is too limiting please let us know.
