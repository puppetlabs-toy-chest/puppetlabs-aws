##Overview

The aws module manages Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources to build out cloud infrastructure.

##Description

Amazon Web Services exposes a powerful API for creating and managing
its Infrastructure as a Service platform. The aws module
allows you to drive that API using Puppet code. In the simplest case,
this allows you to create new EC2 instances from Puppet code. More
importantly, it allows you to describe your entire AWS infrastructure and
to model the relationships between different components.

##Setup

###Requirements

* Puppet 3.4 or greater
* Ruby 1.9
* Amazon AWS Ruby SDK (available as a gem)
* Retries gem

###Installing the aws module

1. Install the retries gem and the Amazon AWS Ruby SDK gem. 

    * If you're using open source Puppet, the SDK gem should be installed into the same Ruby used by Puppet. Install the gems with these commands:

      `gem install aws-sdk-core`

      `gem install retries`

  * If you're running Puppet Enterprise, install both the gems with this command:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/gem install aws-sdk-core retries`

  This allows the gems to be used by the Puppet Enterprise Ruby.

  * If you're running [Puppet Server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server), you need to make both gems available to JRuby with:

      `/opt/puppet/bin/puppetserver gem install aws-sdk-core retries`

  Once the gems are installed, restart Puppet Server.

2. Set these environment variables for your AWS access credentials:

  ~~~
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
  ~~~

  Alternatively, you can place the credentials in a file at
`~/.aws/credentials` based on the following template:

  ~~~
 [default]
  aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
  aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
  ~~~

  If you have Puppet running on AWS, and you're running the module examples, you can instead use [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/). To do this, assign the correct role to the instance from which you're running the examples. For a sample profile with all the required permissions, see the [IAM profile example](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/iam-profile/).

3. Finally, install the module with:

~~~
puppet module install puppetlabs-aws
~~~

#### A note on regions

By default the module looks through all regions in AWS when
determining if something is available. This can be a little slow. If you
know what you're doing you can speed things up by targeting a single
region using an environment variable.

~~~
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
~~~

#### A note on proxies

By default the module accesses the AWS API directly, but if you're in an
environment which doesn't have direct access you can provide a proxy
setting for all traffic like so:

~~~
export PUPPET_AWS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
~~~


##Getting Started with aws

The aws module allows you to manage AWS using the Puppet DSL. To stand up an instance with AWS, use the `ec2_instance` type. The following code sets up a very basic instance:

~~~
ec2_instance { 'instance-name':
  ensure        => present,
  region        => 'us-west-1',
  image_id      => 'ami-123456', # you need to select your own AMI
  instance_type => 't1.micro',
}
~~~

##Usage

###Creating resources

You can also set up more complex EC2 instances with a variety of AWS features, as well as
load balancers and security groups.
 
**Set up an instance:**

~~~
ec2_instance { 'name-of-instance':
  ensure            => present,
  region            => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zone => 'us-east-1a',
  image_id          => 'ami-123456',
  instance_type     => 't1.micro',
  monitoring        => true,
  key_name          => 'name-of-existing-key',
  security_groups   => ['name-of-security-group'],
  user_data         => template('module/file-path.sh.erb'),
  tags              => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

**Set up a security group:**

~~~
ec2_securitygroup { 'name-of-group':
  ensure      => present,
  region      => 'us-east-1',
  description => 'a description of the group',
  ingress     => [{
    protocol  => 'tcp',
    port      => 80,
    cidr      => '0.0.0.0/0',
  },{
    security_group => 'other-security-group',
  }],
  tags        => {
    tag_name  => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

**Set up a load balancer:**

~~~
elb_loadbalancer { 'name-of-load-balancer':
  ensure               => present,
  region               => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zones   => ['us-east-1a', 'us-east-1b'],
  instances            => ['name-of-instance', 'another-instance'],
  security_groups      => ['name-of-security-group'],
  listeners            => [{
    protocol           => 'tcp',
    load_balancer_port => 80,
    instance_protocol  => 'tcp',
    instance_port      => 80,
  }],
  tags                 => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
~~~

To destroy any of these resources, set `ensure => absent`.

### Creating a stack

Let's create a simple stack, with a load balancer, instances, and security groups.

~~~
                          WWW
                           +
                           |
          +----------------|-----------------+
          |     +----------v-----------+     |
    lb-sg |     |         lb-1         |     |
          |     +----+------------+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+  +----v----+     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
   web-sg |     |  web-1  |  |  web-2  |     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
          |     +----+----+  +----+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+       |          |
          |     |         |       |          |
    db-sg |     |  db-1   <-------+          |
          |     |         |                  |
          |     +---------+                  |
          +----------------------------------+
~~~

We've supplied code for the creation of this stack in this module's tests directory. To run this code with Puppet apply, run:

~~~
puppet apply tests/create.pp --test
~~~

If you want to try this out from this directory without installing the
module, run the following:

~~~
puppet apply tests/create.pp --modulepath ../ --test
~~~

To destroy the resources created by the above, run the following:

~~~
puppet apply tests/destroy.pp --test
~~~

### Managing resources from the command line

The module has basic `puppet resource` support, so you can manage AWS resources from the command line. 

For example, the following command lists all the security groups:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup
~~~

You can also create new resources:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=present description="test description" region=us-east-1
~~~

and then destroy them, all from the command line:

~~~
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=absent region=sa-east-1
~~~


### Managing AWS infrastructure

You can use the aws module to audit AWS resources, launch autoscaling groups in VPC, perform unit testing, and more. The [examples](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples) directory in the module contains a variety of usage examples that should give you an idea of what's possible:

* [Puppet Enterprise](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/puppet-enterprise/): Start up a small Puppet Enterprise cluster using the AWS module.

##Limitations

This module requires Ruby 1.9 or later and is only tested on Puppet
versions 3.4 and later.

At the moment this module only supports a few of the resources
in the AWS API. These resources also exist a bit outside the
normal host level resources like `package`, `file`, `user`, etc. We're
really interested to see how people use these new resources, and what
else you would like to be able to do with the module.

Note that this module also requires at least Ruby 1.9 and is only tested on Puppet
versions from 3.4. If this is too limiting please let us know.
