## Overview

The aws module manages Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources to build out cloud infrastructure.

## Description

Amazon Web Services exposes a powerful API for creating and managing its infrastructure as a service platform. The aws module allows you to drive that API using Puppet code. 

In the simplest case, this allows you to create new EC2 instances from Puppet code. More importantly, it allows you to describe your entire AWS infrastructure and to model the relationships between different components.

## Setup

### Requirements

* Puppet 4.7 or greater
* Ruby 1.9 or greater
* Amazon AWS Ruby SDK (available as a gem)
* Retries gem

### Installing the aws module

1. Install the retries gem and the Amazon AWS Ruby SDK gem, using the same Ruby used by Puppet. For Puppet 4.x and beyond, install the gems with this command:

  '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install aws-sdk-core retries'

2. Set these environment variables for your AWS access credentials:

  ```bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
  ```

  Alternatively, you can place the credentials in a file at '~/.aws/credentials' based on the following template:

  ```bash
 [default]
  aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
  aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
  ```

  If you have Puppet running on AWS, and you're running the module examples, you can instead use [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/). To do this, assign the correct role to the instance from which you're running the examples. For a sample profile with all the required permissions, see the [IAM profile example](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/iam-profile/).

3. Finally, install the module with:

  ```bash
puppet module install puppetlabs-aws
  ```

#### A note on regions

By default the module looks through all regions in AWS when determining if something is available. This can be a little slow. If you know what you're doing you can speed things up by targeting a single region using an environment variable.

```bash
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
````

#### A note on proxies

By default the module accesses the AWS API directly, but if you're in an environment that doesn't have direct access you can provide a proxy setting for all traffic like so:

```bash
export PUPPET_AWS_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
```

#### Configuring the aws module using an ini file

The AWS region and HTTP proxy can be provided in a file called 'puppetlabs_aws_configuration.ini' in the Puppet confdir ('$settings::confdir') using this format:

```ini
    [default]
      region = us-east-1
      http_proxy = http://proxy.example.com:80
```

## Usage

### Creating resources

You can set up EC2 instances with a variety of AWS features, as well as a VPC, security group, and load balancer.

**Setup a VPC:**

``` puppet
ec2_vpc { 'name-of-vpc':
  ensure     => present,
  region     => 'us-east-1',
  cidr_block => '10.0.0.0/24',
  tags       => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
```

**Setup a subnet:**

``` puppet
ec2_vpc_subnet { 'name-of-subnet':
  ensure                  => present,
  region                  => 'us-east-1',
  cidr_block              => '10.0.0.0/24',
  availability_zone       => 'us-east-1a',
  map_public_ip_on_launch => true,
  vpc                     => 'name-of-vpc,
  tags                    => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
```

**Setup a security group:**

``` puppet
ec2_securitygroup { 'name-of-security-group':
  ensure      => present,
  region      => 'us-east-1',
  vpc         => 'name-of-vpc',
  description => 'a description of the group',
  ingress     => [{
    protocol  => 'tcp',
    port      => 22,
    cidr      => '0.0.0.0/0',
  }],
  tags        => {
    tag_name  => 'value',
  },
}
```

**Setup an instance:**

``` puppet
ec2_instance { 'name-of-instance':
  ensure            => running,
  region            => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zone => 'us-east-1a',
  image_id          => 'ami-123456', # you need to select your own AMI
  instance_type     => 't2.micro',
  key_name          => 'name-of-existing-key',
  subnet            => 'name-of-subnet',
  security_groups   => ['name-of-security-group'],
  tags              => {
    tag_name => 'value',
  },
}
```

**Setup a load balancer:**

``` puppet
elb_loadbalancer { 'name-of-load-balancer':
  ensure                  => present,
  region                  => 'us-east-1',
  availability_zones      => ['us-east-1a', 'us-east-1b'],
  instances               => ['name-of-instance', 'another-instance'],
  security_groups         => ['name-of-security-group'],
  listeners               => [
    {
      protocol              => 'HTTP',
      load_balancer_port    => 80,
      instance_protocol     => 'HTTP',
      instance_port         => 80,
    },{
      protocol              => 'HTTPS',
      load_balancer_port    => 443,
      instance_protocol     => 'HTTPS',
      instance_port         => 8080,
      ssl_certificate_id    => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789000:server-certificate/yourcert.com',
      policies              =>  [
        {
          'policy_type'       => 'SSLNegotiationPolicyType',
          'policy_attributes' => {
            'Protocol-TLSv1.1' => false,
            'Protocol-TLSv1.2' => true,
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  health_check            => {
    'healthy_threshold'   => '10',
    'interval'            => '30',
    'target'              => 'HTTP:80/health_check',
    'timeout'             => '5',
    'unhealthy_threshold' => '2'
  },
  tags                    => {
    tag_name              => 'value',
  },
}
```

To destroy any of these resources, set `ensure => absent`.

### Creating a stack

Let's create a simple stack, with a load balancer, instances, and security groups.

```
                          WWW
                           +
                           |
          +----------------|-----------------+
          |     +----------v-----------+     |
    lb-sg |     |         lb-1         |     |
          |     +----+------------+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+  +----v----+     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
   web-sg |     |  web-1  |  |  web-2  |     |
          |     |         |  |         |     |
          |     +----+----+  +----+----+     |
          +----------|------------|----------+
          +----------|------------|----------+
          |     +----v----+       |          |
          |     |         |       |          |
    db-sg |     |  db-1   <-------+          |
          |     |         |                  |
          |     +---------+                  |
          +----------------------------------+
```

We've supplied code for the creation of this stack in this module's tests directory. To run this code with Puppet apply, run:

``` bash
puppet apply tests/create.pp --test
```

If you want to try this out from this directory without installing the module, run the following:

```bash
puppet apply tests/create.pp --modulepath ../ --test
```

To destroy the resources created by the above, run the following:

```bash
puppet apply tests/destroy.pp --test
```

### Managing resources from the command line

The module has basic `puppet resource` support, so you can manage AWS resources from the command line.

For example, the following command lists all the security groups:

```bash
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup
```

You can also create new resources:

``` bash
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=present description="test description" region=us-east-1
```

and then destroy them, all from the command line:

``` bash
puppet resource ec2_securitygroup test-group ensure=absent region=sa-east-1
```


### Managing AWS infrastructure

You can use the aws module to audit AWS resources, launch autoscaling groups in VPC, perform unit testing, and more. The [examples](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples) directory in the module contains a variety of usage examples that should give you an idea of what's possible:

* [Puppet Enterprise](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-aws/tree/master/examples/puppet-enterprise/): Start up a small Puppet Enterprise cluster using the AWS module.

##### `task_definition`

Required.

The name of the task definition to run.

#### Type: ecs_task_definition

Type representing ECS clusters.

ECS task definitions can be a bit fussy.  To discover the existing containers we use the 'name' option within a container definition to calculate the differences between what is, and what should be.  Omitting the 'name' option may be done, but it would result in a new container being generated each Puppet run, and thus a new task definition.  For this reason it is recommended that  the 'name' option be defined in each container definition and that the name chosen be unique within an 'ecs_task_definition' resource.

``` puppet
ecs_task_definition { 'dockerdocker':
  container_definitions => [
    {
      'name'          => 'zleslietesting',
      'cpu'           => '1024',
      'environment'   => {
        'one' => '1',
        'two' => '2',
      },
      'essential'     => 'true',
      'image'         => 'debian:jessie',
      'memory'        => '512',
      'port_mappings' => [
        {
          'container_port' => '8081',
          'host_port'      => '8082',
          'protocol'       => 'tcp',
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
}
```

It's important to consider the behavior of the provider in the case of missing container options.

If the task for an 'ecs_task_definition' has been discovered to exist, then the discovered container options are merged with the requested options.  This results in the following behavior: *Container options not defined in the puppet resource, but are found to exist in the discovered running container are copied from the running container.*

In the case where a user wishes to remove an option from the container, one of the following can be applied.

* Name the container something else.  This results in a failure to match the existing container against the desired container, and replaces the container entirely.

* Set an empty value for the option.  This results in the option specified by the user replacing the value defined in the existing container.  For string options, simply setting the value to `''`, or as an array value `[]`, etc.

##### `container_definitions`

An array of hashes representing the container definition.  See the example above.

##### `name`

Required.

The name of the task to manage.

  },
}
```

##### `replace_image`

This is useful in environments where external CI tooling is responsible for modifying the image of a container, allowing a dualistic approach for managing ECS.

Required.

An array of user names to include in the group.  Users not specified in this array will be removed.

#### Type: iam_instance_profile

``` puppet
iam_instance_profile { 'my_iam_role':
  ensure  => present,
  roles => [ 'my_iam_role' ],
}
```

##### `ensure`

Specifies the basic state of the resource. 

Valid values are: 'present', 'absent'.

##### `name`

Required.

The name of the IAM instance profile.

##### `roles`

Optional. 

The IAM role(s) to associate this instance profile with. 

Accepts an array for multiple roles.

#### Type: iam_policy

[IAMPolicies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) manage access to AWS resources.  The 'iam_policy' type only manages the document content of the policy, and not which entities have the policy attached.  See the 'iam_policy_attachment' type for managing the application of the policy created with the 'iam_policy' type.

``` puppet
iam_policy { 'root':
  ensure      => present,
  document    => '{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "*",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }',
}
```

It is worth noting here that the 'iam_policy' type will allow the creation of an IAM policy who's name is identical to the built-in policies.  In such a case when two policies exist with the same name, one built-in and one user-defined, the user-defined is selected for management.

##### `document`

Required.

A string containing the IAM policy in JSON format.

#### Type: iam_policy_attachment

The 'iam_policy_attachment' resource manages which entities are attached to the named policy.  See the note in the 'iam_policy' above about duplicate policy name selection.

You only need to set the 'users', 'groups' or 'roles' parameters to manage the policy attachments for those resources.  Leaving one of those parameters undefined ignores the attachment for those entities.  Defining attachment for an entity as an empty array will detach all entities of that flavor from the named policy.

``` puppet
iam_policy_attachment { 'root':
  groups => ['root'],
  users  => [],
}
```

##### `groups`

Optional.

An array of group names to attach to the policy.  

**If not mentioned in this array it will be detached from the policy.**

##### `users`

Optional.

An array of user names to attach to the policy.  

**If not mentioned in this array it will be detached from the policy.**

##### `roles`

Optional.

An array of role names to attach to the policy.  

**If not mentioned in this array it will be detached from the policy.**

#### Type: iam_role

The 'iam_role' type manages IAM roles.  

``` puppet
iam_role { 'devtesting':
  ensure => present,
  policy_document => '[
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]',
}
```

All parameters are read-only once created.

##### `ensure`

Specifies the basic state of the resource. 

Valid values are: 'present', 'absent'.

##### `name`

The name of the IAM role

##### `path`

Optional.

Role path

##### `policy_document`

A string containing the IAM policy in JSON format which controls which entities may assume this role.

Default:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### `arn`

The Amazon Resource Name for this IAM role.

#### Type: iam_user

The 'iam_user' type manages user accounts in IAM.  Only the user's name is required as the title of the resource.

``` puppet
iam_user { 'alice':
  ensure => present,
}

iam_user { 'bob':
  ensure => present,
}
```

#### Type: kms

The 'kms' type manages KMS key lifecycle and their policies.  The name of the resource is prefixed with 'alias/' to set the alias of the KMS key, since keys themselves don't have any notion of name, outside of an attached alias.

``` puppet
kms { 'somekey':
  ensure => present,
  policy => template('my/policy.json'),
}
```

The above resource may be viewable elsewhere as 'alias/somekey'.

##### `policy`

The JSON policy document to manage on the given KMS key.

## Limitations

This module requires Ruby 1.9 or later and is only tested on Puppet versions 3.4 and later.

At the moment this module only supports a few of the resources in the AWS API. These resources also exist a bit outside the normal host level resources like 'package', 'file', 'user', etc. 

We're really interested to see how people use these new resources, and what else you would like to be able to do with the module.

Note that this module also requires at least Ruby 1.9 and is only tested on Puppet versions from 3.4.
